    I am a <b>Full Stack Software Developer</b> and <b>QA Analyst</b>, with a degree in <b>Computer Engineering</b> from Politécnico Colombiano Jaime Isaza Cadavid. I specialize in building scalable web applications using <b>JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Java</b>, while ensuring high-quality standards through <b>manual testing</b> and <b>automated testing with Selenium</b>.
    <br /><br />
    I am passionate about software quality, clean code, and effective collaboration in multidisciplinary teams, working under the <b>Scrum methodology</b>. My curiosity and commitment to continuous learning have led me to actively engage with the tech community as part of <b>PionerasDev</b> and attend events such as MedellínCSS, CSSConfColombia, JSConfCO, and more.
    <br /><br />
    I aspire to grow into a <b>Scrum Master</b> role, leading teams where technology, design, and quality converge to create meaningful and impactful digital experiences.
